# Hains

This is a project making an AI based exhibition curator. He's called Hains after Hans Ulrich Obrist.
The purpose of Hains is to output a document containing artists, links to resources on the artists, descriptions of the artist and summary of the purpose of the exhibition and its artistic value.
This document could be used by a real curator to set up an exhibition.

Hains is able to work with a seed, for example an initial artist name, or an artistic style, or a longer description of what the proposed exhibition should be about, and go search on the internet and make artistic decisions on its own, weigh off between found artists whether they fit in the exhibition, and will generate a report with findings, along with a search and decision report to show how it came to its conclusion.
